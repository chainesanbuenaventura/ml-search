"The project schedule developed at appraisal required all project contracts to be awarded  either before or immediately after grant approval and did not provide for an interval between grant  approval and grant effectivity. This was unrealistic. Furthermore, even though a grant covenant  required that the contractor shall not be allowed access to any section of the line route until all  resettlement issues were resolved, the project schedule made no provision for their resolution. In  an EPC contract—in which the contractor is responsible for design—the design approval,  resolution of resettlement issues, and construction are sequential activities, and this should be  provided in the project schedule. Project schedules should also incorporate realistic timeframes  for processing of contracts, and ideally provide some accommodation for inevitable delays.",Sequencing of project works 
"Lessons learned bear out the same lessons from earlier policy-based programs: (i) build  on ownership for reform; (ii) build on existing efforts; (iii) accommodate evolving policy dialogue; (iv) carefully time the intervention; (v) employ participation and build consensus; (vi) incorporate  the need for capacity and institutional development; (vii) keep the design simple and allow for  flexibility in the design; (viii) sequence reforms; and (ix) monitor progress (footnote 7). One further  lesson, given the experience of this program, is for ADB to stay fully engaged with the program  of reforms, whether or not program funds are scheduled to be disbursed in a particular year. All  future policy-based programs should be directed to consider these lessons in program design. In  retrospect, a stand-alone policy-based grant and loan would have been preferable to a  programmatic approach.",Scaling reforms through policy based lending 
"In situations where the executing agency is unfamiliar with the project delivery approach  planned at appraisal, such as the use of turnkey contracts, it would be helpful to provide  implementation support through a consultant. The FMC was appointed almost 1.5 years after  project approval and lasted for 1 year only due to poor performance. A new firm was hired 1.5  year after termination of the previous FMC. The absence of consultants delayed finalization of  engineering design for turnkey subprojects and completion of related safeguards documentation  in previous tranches. Had experienced support been available sooner, the time required to put  turnkey projects in place may have been reduced.","To avoid delays, support is required to help executing agencies with unfamiliar project plans and ADB requirements. "
"The MFF structure allowed for transfer of cancelled loan amounts to subsequent tranches.  This attests to the suitability of this financing modality for the type of investments required by a  distribution asset operator. There are multiple projects to be financed with ever changing demand.  The availability of the facility allows for subprojects that become ready or more urgent to be picked  up by earlier tranches. In some cases, delays caused by technical challenges can be remedied  by transferring the subproject to subsequent tranches.","MFF should be considered for complex projects in volatile regions, as its flexible tranche-based operation reduces risk."
"The project was completed without cost overrun and achieved its outputs in 6 years. The  main contributing factors were (i) strong government commitment; (ii) well-designed core  subprojects, including their demonstration impact to subsequent subprojects; (iii) suitable scope  of the subproject and efficient preparation; and (iv) timely counterpart funding from local  government.", Implementation efficiency
"Procurement and low bid prices. This has been observed as a growing phenomenon  across many ADB projects, as well as those funded by other donors, in the PRC. This  phenomenon is a result of many issues, including overestimating during bid preparation, price  analysis during bid evaluation, and low capacity of the implementing agency in contract  management. Most specifically, the cost estimate in the procurement plan is based on a feasibility  study report in the PRC, and the risk premium is always high in feasibility study report estimates.  More advance preparation will improve the accuracy of the cost estimates. While a recent  procurement reform in ADB should help address this situation,30 certain additional measures  should be considered to avoid further negative impacts on loan utilization. Such measures could  be related to more accurate bid preparations, including detailed designs and cost estimates, and  price analysis during bid evaluation. ADB and the PMO should make significant efforts to  strengthen the capacity of the implementing agency on procurement matters. Improvements in  the existing PRC's tracking system for sanctioned local bidders would also be essential for  addressing the problem. 30 The latest Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers refer to cases of abnormally low bids, where after careful examination, the borrower is given the option to reject the bid or request that the amount of the performance security  be increased at the expense of the bidder.",Accuracy of cost estimates
"Project extensions related to land acquisition and resettlement. Local governments  in the PRC are increasingly adopting a more cautious approach towards solving land acquisition  and resettlement issues. This has often led to extensions requests by the borrower in order to  complete the implementation of the project. When considering such type of extension requests,  ADB should undertake an extensive due diligence to assess whether the completion of the project  is achievable within the proposed extended timeline. This due diligence should not be just  undertaken by the project implementation consultants but also by an external specialist contracted  for this specific task.",Project implementation extension due to land acquisition
"Overall, the project was less than successful. 23  The project was implemented with  substantial delays and major changes in the financing plan, within project cost but with 69.3% of  ADB loan proceeds canceled. It was completed with a delay of over 4 years and required the  use of additional government resources. The total project cost was reduced because ADB and  the government did not extend the loan. The government has continuous ownership and  leadership of the Treasury's modernization, but has reduced its commitment to the PFM reform  timeline.",Government ownership in PFM reform
"PMO and executing agency staff need to improve their understanding of the agreed  timing, ADB's procurement guidelines, and government laws and regulations on procurement to  minimize any conflict between ADB guidelines and government requirements before starting  procurement. This includes involving the executing agency's bidding committee members early  in the project to avoid any possible conflict during procurement.",Early involvement of bidding committee members early
"One of the more significant issues was managing borrower expectations, particularly (i)  the time needed to complete the procurement process under ADB guidelines and (ii) the  expected versus the actual bid prices. Both issues caused distress between the donor and the  executing agency—expectations of the time needed to complete a transaction are often  unrealistic and bid prices are higher than expected—especially when the executing agency has  limited exposure to ADB procedures and to the prices of the goods and services proposed  under the project.",Unrealistic bid prices
"Land pooling proved to be a highly effective process for urban development. Financing an  untested and innovative approach clearly resulted in transformational impacts regarding how  urban areas are developed in the country. The key delay at start-up was corrected by starting  work in a subset of one local area where 100% agreement had already been achieved (para. 25).  Another lesson learned in land pooling is that proper sequencing of works can lead to better  outcomes. Initially, roads were finished in the areas under land pooling prior to private building  construction, which led to extensive road damage from movement of heavy vehicles (para. 17).", Transformations in urban area development
"In comparison with previous urban loans, the project increased coverage to more cities.  The uneven capacities in three areas were reflected through the funds allocated to the areas and  the capacity building program designed under the project. Dagana was an area that ADB had not  previously supported and it is also where there were some quality issues in the infrastructure built.  Capacity could not be built as envisioned because of changes in government policy related to the  funding of training. This could have been better bridged by increased consulting services;  however, toward the end of the project, there was also increased focus on optimizing consulting  services in donor-funded projects, which made it difficult to increase allocations to Dagana. While  the slope stability study for Dagana was delayed because of the challenges of working in a difficult  terrain, the delay could have been better managed by stronger supervision (para. 26). 34 For example, there is a need to further strengthen capacity in accounting and financial management, preparing bid",Alignment of government policy for capacity building
"The project correctly identified the capacity requirements. Projects need to ensure that  capacity building programs designed and agreed upon during project preparation are  implemented. While there may be changes in government policies regarding the use of loan funds,  clear agreements should be made that tie the financing of components to demonstration of  capacity or agreement with government to provide sufficient consulting services, particularly for  construction supervision.",Agreements tying financing to capacity building and consulting services are important
Constraints in capacity requirements can also be addressed through a phased approach  in implementing the various components. There were many components being simultaneously  implemented. Better sequencing may have improved implementation by allowing the personnel  implementing and supervising the works to focus on fewer components. Supervision in remote  sites like Dagana should be ensured; ADB supervision also needs to be better planned in this  regard. Higher levels of supervision resulted in better infrastructure quality in Thimphu and  Phuentsholing compared with Dagana.,Sequencing components and supervision are important
"Choice of project modality, scope, and implementation arrangements should be carefully  assessed and deliberately considered at project preparation. Project management faced  challenges beginning with initial implementation as the project comprised multiple  subcomponents scattered across many locations, resulting in a multilayered project  administrative structure. Combined with a requirement to conclude on-lending agreements  backed by stringent counter-guarantee arrangements across the PIAs and local governments, the  required coordination among relevant local government agencies was significant. It resulted in (i)  limited flexibility to respond to immediate implementation needs; and (ii) delays, which resulted in  advanced implementation of several subproject without the use of ADB loan financing. A flexible  approach that allowed individual subprojects to become effective when individual requirements  were met would have avoided this situation.",Complex projects should use appropriate flexible financing modalities to reduce implementation inefficiencies and delays.
"Urban development plans should be thoroughly reviewed and assessed to identify  potential risks at project preparation and thereby minimize subsequent changes in scope, and  attendant implementation delays. The district heating subproject faced a change in heat source  location, which affected both the original scope of works and implementation schedule. It was  caused by the limited coordination between the urban development plan and heating supply  investment planning. Heating reforms are expected to include tightened integration of district  heating investment and urban development planning.",Due diligence of urban development plans is essential to avoid costly changes during implementation.
"A strong project steering committee with close coordination across relevant local  government agencies is essential for smooth project implementation. The project structure—with  multiple subcomponents in scattered locations and a multi-layer project administrative structure— required strong leadership of the project leading group, which served to guide project  implementation.",Strong project leaders are essential to implement complex projects successfully.
"The project modality and scope should be carefully considered during project preparation.  The simple stand-alone project loan modality is less advantageous when implementing a multi- component project that involves a wide range of subsectors and project proponents, unless the  executing agency has strong project management capacity. Given a sound development policy  and firm medium-term investment plan, a more flexible project modality—such as financial  intermediation and results-based lending—should be considered. Alternatively, the project scope  should be well focused to minimize the complexity of project management.","Stand alone projects are not well designed to deal with highly complex operations, and alternative modalities are preferred."
"Urban development plans should be carefully assessed in preparation of any district  heating project. The relevance and effectiveness of the district heating project design (heat source,  generation capacity, and transmission and distribution) depend entirely on urban zoning, which is  linked to commercial and public building construction planning, industrial complex development,  and population growth projections. 16 ADB. 2Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the People's Republic of China for Low Carbon District Heating Project in Huhhot in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Loan  3218-PRC).

"The strong commitment and ownership of the project proponents is critical to the success  of a demonstration project that uses the latest technologies for the first time in a country.  Establishing a dedicated entity responsible for the review of the technical design, construction  and operation of the project facilities is a key success factor. Similarly, strong institutional support  is crucial to ensure the viability of a project with complex challenges.",Ownership and an institutional structure are critical elements for innovative projects.  
"Adoption of a relatively young technology that has yet to establish a robust performance  track record and achieve lower capital and operating costs, but offers significant improvement  potential in terms of lower CO2 capture costs, can be realized. Meticulous attention to technical  design, operating standards and associated costs can deliver commercial attractiveness and  competitiveness with other power generation technologies. As highlighted in the knowledge  products, the PRC is well positioned to benefit from economies of scale through limiting  production costs, and standardization. However, reaching the necessary performance  requirements for the plant is critical. Continuing research and improvements to enhance efficiency  and bring down O&M costs will be indispensable.",New technology offers great potential in the right circumstances. 
"Obtaining assistance from international and national experts in the field is helpful. The  grant-funded consultants conducted technical studies that identified areas of improvement in the  design and operating procedures, and the monitoring and control of plant performance  parameters. These supplemented the knowledge and observations of the plant operators and  maintenance personnel.",The role of experts
"The Tianjin IGCC demonstration project is the first of its kind not only in the PRC, but in  any developing member country. Valuable lessons can be shared with other developing member  countries that are contemplating such projects. Comparison of international experiences with that  of the PRC as well as valuable lessons learned in the development of IGCC technology are well  documented in the knowledge products funded by the grant. Importantly, a roadmap for CCS  technology was also prepared in parallel with the project's implementation, which lends this  project and the IGCC technology in an advantageous position for future application of the CCS at  this plant to reduce its carbon foot prints.29 Continuing collaboration with industry leaders, policy  makers and experts through exchange of information can pave the way for larger replication of  the IGCC power plants throughout the PRC. 29 The roadmap for CCS demonstration and deployment in the PRC (ADB. 2Roadmap for Carbon Capture and Storage Demonstration and Deployment. Manila.) was jointly prepared by ADB and NDRC's Department of Climate  Change, which is spearheading CCS commercial development in the PRC. It was jointly launched in a high-level  side event at the Community of Practice (COP) 21 meetings in Paris. CCS is included as an important technology in  PRC's nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement.",Collaboration across stakeholders in the energy project
"Incentivizing efficiency. The time-based nature of contracts used for the CPIU  consultant did not provide any incentives for quality delivery. Further, there were no specific  incentives to encourage the government to meet its obligations, particularly in recruiting critical  roles and contributing funding to the NTF as planned. While the Sustainable Transport  Infrastructure Improvement Program has adopted results-based lending, program implementation  remains challenging, with several of the DLIs not met in 2Ongoing support for the results- based approach will be required.",Contracting type and incentives scheme in the transport sector
"Long-term approach. Consistent with the lessons from recent projects (footnote 7),  achieving a sector-based approach as a focal point for funding and donor coordination is a long- term journey. The project built a solid foundation for further progress in developing a  programmatic, results-based approach. Sequencing for the Sustainable Transport Infrastructure  Improvement Program should ensure an early focus on sustaining government ownership,  institutionalizing effective asset management, and improving the quality of civil works.",Result-based approach for transport projects
"Information needs and analysis. Major project decisions were made without sufficient  data and analysis, such as shifting from rehabilitation to maintenance after the midterm review  without any business case or economic assessment. The Sustainable Transport Infrastructure  Improvement Program would benefit from a more rigorous understanding of assumptions,  benefits, and costs. Preparation for larger projects requires greater support from development  partners to minimize cost overruns, delays, and other hurdles such as land.38",Evidence based project decision making 
"Key lessons derived from the project design, implementation and completion: (i) Successful implementation of infrastructure project requires adequate social  preparation and continued engagement with the local communities. The project  was successful in engaging with local communities and address their immediate  needs with social infrastructure and support services. This helped gain their trust  and buy-in for the project. (ii) Since the MFF will be executed in 10 years, adequate institutional capacity within  the executing and implementing agencies is required. It was premature for a new  state with weak capacity. Other financing options would have been more  appropriate. (iii) Uttarakhand being a special category state, 90% of the central government  external debt fund is passed on to the project as a grant. However, the CERC Tariff  Regulation does not allow its return, interest, and depreciation in the revenue  calculation. While grant funding may benefit end-users due to a lower tariff, it may  not be an appropriate funding model for a revenue-earning agency like PTCUL. (iv) The project DMF had indicated a risk factor in achieving the project outcome  should the hydro projects not be completed on time. However, the risk mitigation  measures were not adequately planned. (v) Core functions of UED are administrative in nature; its priority and focus are mostly  on policy formulation and regulation of energy sector for the state. UED did not  have adequate project management and engineering staff. Hence, for UED, the  role as a project executing agency was conflicting and therefore, it was less  effective. The PMO also could not contribute effectively except as a role of the  secretariat. (vi) The second component of the project on institutional strengthening did not have a  need-based framework for capacity development in the project design stage. For  capacity development, the project could have benefitted from establishing cross- learning processes in project management, technical competency, and social  engineering among PTCUL, UJVNL and UED with other utilities. In the absence of  strong PMO and UED's ownership, the mid-term review of late 2012 also could not  help in developing such cross-learning framework.",Selection of financing modality and institutional capacity strengthening
"Covenants and conditions in the loan agreement and the project agreement. The  project should avoid conditions and covenants that cannot be measured, monitored and  managed. They should be properly monitored and managed by keeping at a manageable number.",Covenants and conditions in the loan agreement and the project agreement. 
"MFF success and impediments factors. ADB should undertake a thematic study on  barriers to MFF implementation and enabling environment, so that member countries can be  advised on the suitability of MFF for development intervention. Such evaluation can provide cross  learning on key barriers to MFF approach, and the ways to mitigate them with innovative solutions.",MFF success and impediments factors need to be evaluated. 
"Ensure the implementation period is realistic. The project implementation plan should  be realistic. Sufficient time for project readiness, such as the environmental and social  preparation, and for buy-ins from the local communities and stakeholders should be factored in.  Other issues such as, procurement capacity of the entities need to be properly assessed and  factored.",Ensure realistic implementation period
"Ensure high due diligence of associated facilities. Due diligence of associated  facilities, funded by the private sector and other agencies, and identification of the likely risks and  their proper mitigation are critical to the success of the projects. Appropriate agreements on the  use of facilities, and the risk-sharing and guaranteed revenue mechanism with beneficiaries and  end-users must be ensured at the project appraisal stage and before the financing commitment.",Ensure high due diligence of associated facilities. 
"The following major lessons emerged from the project:   (i) Although activities for disseminating the sustainable reservoir rehabilitation and 22  The methodology is provided in ADB. 2Guidelines for the Evaluation of Public Sector Operations. Manila. management models established under the loan and associated TA were actively  conducted and continue to be conducted, replication of the models beyond  Shandong is beyond the project's control; it can be lengthy, and depends on  decisions by other governments. (ii) Effective use of advance contracting and retroactive financing ensured efficient  project implementation and helped enable all project activities to be completed by  the original loan closing date. (iii) The main reason the contract price is lower than the engineering estimate is  inaccuracies in the engineering cost estimate. (iv) The initial imprest account ceiling was set at 10% of the approved loan amount;  this proved insufficient for a project that effectively used advance contracting and  retroactive financing, and was increased to 15% of the approved loan amount. (v) Public participation should have been strengthened by involving more local people  who lived in low density areas around the subproject sites, far from communities. (vi) The establishment of a good and workable grievance redress procedure is  important in resolving grievances. (vii) Dialogue and consultation with affected persons helps in resolving grievances.  (viii) Smooth LAR implementation benefits from careful preparation of resettlement plans during project preparation, including clear definition of land ownership,  strong coordination between project preparation consultants and executing and  implementing agencies, and understanding of resettlement plans by executing and  implementing agencies before ADB approval of the resettlement plans.","Project planning, management and due diligence.  "
"Design and monitoring framework. Some of the expected performance targets and  indicators formulated in the DMF were aligned more with the overall investment program, and a  separate DMF for the project was not prepared. Apart from the DMF for the MFF, a DMF should  be prepared for each tranche under the MFF, which should be distinct, specific, and directly  attributable to the respective tranche so that its achievement against the project-specific  indicators and targets can be suitably evaluated.",MFF Project processing including DMF development  
"Post-construction performance-based maintenance. The contractors' performance in  post-construction performance-based maintenance was poor due to the inadequate deployment  of equipment and labor, primarily due to the low rates quoted for post-construction maintenance  for these contracts. Due to their general construction orientation, the contractors did not carry  out post-construction maintenance adequately. In addition, PWD staff were unfamiliar with  supervising performance-based maintenance contracts. It was difficult to determine the  contractors' liability according to performance parameters for damage caused by heavy rains,  snow, or geological factors, which are highly prevalent in Uttarakhand. These lessons were  incorporated under subsequent tranches by strengthening the contractual provisions for  undertaking post-construction maintenance and conducting training and capacity-building  programs for the PWD staff and contractors.",Role of the post-construction phase critical to success. 
"Infrastructure management component. The project's infrastructure management  component delivered useful reports imparting an international outlook as to how the PWD  should be reorganized and perform its operations. However, the consultants' short 1-year  contract period resulted in inadequate interaction between the IMC and the PWD's senior  management and slowed the achievement of the milestones established under the project's  infrastructure management component. A longer contract period for consulting services and  more intensive inputs are required to sensitize the PWD's senior management and state  government and facilitate the design and implementation of an institutional development and  capacity- building program. Nonetheless, activities initiated during the services of IMC were   continued by the consultants engaged under subsequent tranches of the MFF.",Better alignment of the timing and terms of reference of the consultant with the project's capacity building objectives.
"Optimize project management. To strengthen project management, it is vital to (i) clearly  define the roles and responsibilities of members of the project leading group to intensify  interdepartmental cooperation; and (ii) make efforts to minimize replacement of staff to ensure  continuity in project management experience and smoother implementation.",Clearly define project lead roles and responsibilities and minimize staff turnover to strengthen project management.  
"Project preparation is important. A key element of the project's success was the  preparation of templates for the production base construction contract, the loan guarantee 16  ADB. 2Guidelines for the Evaluation of Public Sector Operations. Manila. contract, and the onlending contract, which standardized the implementation of activities across  the project. Although the process took time to prepare in the first year of implementation, once  completed, it was easy to implement and resulted in timely project completion.","Advance preparation of standard document templates is needed to ensure standardized, timely project implementation."
"Access to rural finance is transformative. The project achieved its objective to increase  rural incomes through improved agriculture production by giving loans to poor rural households,  which allowed them to invest in perennial, annual, and livestock production. These loans were  suitable for poor rural farmers because they had lower interest rates and longer tenors than the  loans typically available at commercial banks. They were more in line with the return on  investments that can be achieved from agricultural production systems, and allowed the poor  households to repay them without undue stress. All households that took out loans used the funds  for the purpose intended and repaid the loans. Giving the poor access to finance can enable them  to seize opportunities to increase their incomes and improve their livelihoods.",Access to rural finance is needed to increase poor rural farmer incomes.
"Technical support and training are crucial elements. Access to technical training was  the most appreciated aspect of the project after access to loans. The training provided those who  took out loans with the skills, knowledge, and capacity to apply good agriculture practices and  use latest technologies such as water-efficient irrigation systems and integrated pest  management, all of which resulted in high-quality produce. Farmers were confident to manage  their production systems with the new skills they learned and could access the follow-up technical  support provided.",Technical training is needed to give borrowers skills in good agriculture practices to deliver high-quality produce.
Establishing market links benefits the poor. Awareness about markets and access to  market information meant the farmers could make informed trading decisions. Additional benefit  was gained when individual farmers linked up with agro-enterprises through guaranteed buyback  schemes. Farmers could benefit from higher prices than those available in the open market and  now have a secured income source based on buyback contracts. Agro-enterprises benefited from  access to commodities that were of the required quality and strengthened their resource base.  The “enterprise + production base + farmer” model that was applied in this project was successful  and demonstrated that market links can be mutually beneficial.,Awareness campaigns about market links benefit the poor with higher prices and the buyers with security of supply. 
"Bills of quantities. In the main civil works contract, bills of quantities were sometimes  overly complex and time-consuming in measuring simple items of work. For instance, for simple  culverts, there could be 11 separate items requiring small measurements: excavation, gravel  bedding, lean mix concrete foundation, pipes, pipe joints, reinforcing in end walls, concrete volume in end walls, waterproofing, and backfilling. If the requirements were specified and  detailed on the drawings, a simple linear meter rate incorporating all those items would have been  included. Once the work had been inspected and found compliant, measurement would have  been simpler and more accurate. This approach would have simplified contract administration  without any negative impact on project cost and quality.",Clear contract terms and input requirements are needed to more quickly and accurately confirm completion of works. 
"Design and specification changes. During implementation, some designs and  specifications were revised to better adjust to site conditions and improve the quality of  construction material. Some of the engineering design standards (e.g., Asian Highway standards)  and the design-and-build approach used in the main civil works contract were new to the  executing agency, which led to some misunderstandings. This required resolution by  management staff from the contractor, PMWSC, and PIURR, which took a lot of time and delayed  the addressing of project requirements. If this approach is to be used, care is needed in project  and bidding document preparation so (i) the contractor can program its design and works in  accordance with its method statement, and (ii) the executing agency can ensure approval of the  engineering design in accordance with prevailing government procedures. Regarding (ii), a  clearer framework is needed to ensure that design or specification changes are reviewed by  relevant authorities and approved in a timely fashion. This will avoid causing contractual delays  while enhancing the transparency and robustness of audit processes.",Clear design and bidding document specifications are required for process transparency and to avoid contracting delays  
"Capacity development. Most of the previous TA and projects in Tajikistan's road sector  had capacity development elements within their scope. This led to short and piecemeal inputs  over time, which made it difficult to sustain benefits at the institutional and sector levels. This was  compounded by the staff turnover in MOT management and the overall focus on civil works and  disbursements. Further emphasis is needed on capacity development to advance the road  sustainability agenda and deliver on the country's transport sector master plan (footnote 14).",Increased emphasis on capacity development is required to advance the road sustainability agenda in the transport sector
"Design and monitoring framework. The baselines and targets included in the project  DMF should have been based on reliable and easily accessible data. The DMF indicators should  have been carefully defined to better align with country's commitments and ADB results  framework while leveraging existing global monitoring tools and platforms such as the Sustainable  Development Goals. At the project level, for instance, traffic and fatalities are better measured by  “density targets” i.e., average daily vehicle-km or average crash rate per 100,000 vehicle-km of  travel.",Design and monitoring frameworks targets should be based on reliable and available data to measure project progress. 
"Following the lessons learned from the completed 220 kV GIS, the project applied a  different approach and arrangement as remedial action for civil works acceleration. Based on their  nature, the construction works were divided into five different lots to employ more local  subcontractors47 (against only one involved in the 220 kV GIS project) to enable them to have  access to larger man power and civil material resources, and to work simultaneously thus  reducing further delays and poor performance in the completion of civil works.",Dividing up civil works in lots and employing more local subcontractors improved quality and timeliness of civil works.
"Although the project's output was successfully and fully completed, there were  procurement and implementation delays. These delays point to the need to allow adequate time  for tendering and implementation due to NHEPP energy shut-down schedules, logistical  challenges (i.e., mountainous location, regional transportation obstacles, and absence of air  transport), complexity of and difficulties in civil works, and limited local sources. Also, ADB should  ensure that in future BT and PMU fully understand its procurement processes from project  inception through training and explanation in the project administration memorandum of the  importance of timely and accurate procurement.",Project plans must have adequate time to deliver projects in complex circumstances while complying with ADB processes. 
"As the newly built 500 kV GIS comprises advanced technology and is the first of this type  in Tajikistan, its proper and reliable O&M requires new skills. Therefore, further onsite training  and extension of the defect liability period from 18 months to 24 months are needed to ensure the  sustainability of the project's operational life. 45 Business enterprises and the population benefit from a stable electricity supply service and long-term cost reductions resulting from the economic distribution of electricity from NHEPP and the efficiencies gained from the enhanced  transmission. 46 Through NHEPP's new sustainable and reliable power generation the (i) the crucial role of frequency regulation in  Central Asia will be achieved again, and (ii) surplus energy to Uzbekistan (through the 500 kV Nurek–Regar–Guzar  transmission lines) will be supplied again after Tajikistan's power system reconnection to CAPS (expected in 2018). 47  Subcontractors were selected among the prequalified, locally available companies and approved by BT. The  prequalification was based on (i) contractor experience, (ii) references, (iii) staff capacity (workers and engineers),  and (iv) availability of machinery.",Appropriate training programs are required to support operation and maintenance of projects using new technology.
"The design and monitoring framework performance indicators are likely ambitious and  need to be adequately defined, measurable, and specific to the project area, and should be limited  to those that are needed and relevant. One performance indicator, for BT to become financially  viable by 2011, will take many more years before this can be achieved as the successful  completion of the three-phase restructuring process of BT comprising commercialization,  separation, and privatization is required.",Performance indicators need to be measurable and within the scope of the project to be of use in determining success.
"Lessons from the preparation and implementation of the project are: (i) Care should be taken to endure that research topics are in line with the  government's macro level priorities. As discussed in paragraph 17, the financing  framework study had to be cancelled because the financing responsibility was  moved from the EA to the local government. (ii) Identification of the locations for rural village bus service pilots should be  demand-driven and consistent with the development priorities of county level  governments. As stated in paragraph 15, two pilot sites (Shipai and Xiaowei)  were cancelled because there were already established bus routes within their  areas with committed resources. (iii) Risk management should consider major factors beyond the control of the  executing agency, such as the 4 km road link to the XME that required the  agreement of the Jiangsu provincial government, and thus was outside the  control of the APG (see paragraph 25 and 36). (iv) The traffic forecast should have been more realistic and considered low traffic volume in the initial years of operation. It should have excluded the  uncontrollable factors such as the traffic volume of the 4 km linking section (see  paragraph 36 and paragraph 5 and 6 in Appendix 8).",Local conditions must be considered in the design of PRC transport projects to ensure appropriate design and planning.
"For project implementation, ADB should have a special mechanism that focuses on  acknowledging or rewarding advanced technology and the use of new materials, especially for  projects with outstanding achievement in these areas. Such new technologies and materials  should be shared not only within the PRC but also through South-South cooperation.",New special technology should be shared in South-South cooperation.

"The results of the prefeasibility study should be subject to further examination in the  feasibility study in complex engineering project. As the preliminary study of the Interconnection  conducted by NPC suggested one particular option, NPC was reluctant to include a comparative  study to examine alternatives in the Consultant's TOR, and ADB accepted this position. As a  result, the Project experienced some delays and additional costs when the recommendation of  the POE on the configuration of the Interconnection (para. 28) was adopted. ADB and EAs  should be cautious not to limit technical alternatives to a minimum number, and to make TORs  flexible enough to allow consultants to propose other alternatives that should benefit the  projects, especially in complex engineering studies.",Complex studies require flexible consultant TORs

Such new technologies and materials  should be shared not only within the PRC but also through South-South cooperation.",New special technology should be shared in South-South cooperation. 
"Lessons from the preparation and implementation of the project are: (i) Care should be taken to endure that research topics are in line with the  government's macro level priorities. As discussed in paragraph 17, the financing  framework study had to be cancelled because the financing responsibility was  moved from the EA to the local government. (ii) Identification of the locations for rural village bus service pilots should be  demand-driven and consistent with the development priorities of county level  governments. As stated in paragraph 15, two pilot sites (Shipai and Xiaowei)  were cancelled because there were already established bus routes within their  areas with committed resources. (iii) Risk management should consider major factors beyond the control of the  executing agency, such as the 4 km road link to the XME that required the  agreement of the Jiangsu provincial government, and thus was outside the  control of the APG (see paragraph 25 and 36). (iv) The traffic forecast should have been more realistic and considered low traffic volume in the initial years of operation. It should have excluded the  uncontrollable factors such as the traffic volume of the 4 km linking section (see  paragraph 36 and paragraph 5 and 6 in Appendix 8).",Local conditions must be considered in the design of PRC transport projects to ensure appropriate design and planning.
"In situations where the executing agency is unfamiliar with the project delivery approach  planned at appraisal, such as the use of turnkey contracts, it would be helpful to provide  implementation support through a consultant. The FMC was appointed almost 1.5 years after  project approval and lasted for 1 year only due to poor performance. A new firm was hired 1.5  year after termination of the previous FMC. The absence of consultants delayed finalization of  engineering design for turnkey subprojects and completion of related safeguards documentation  in previous tranches.

"Although the project's output was successfully and fully completed, there were  procurement and implementation delays. These delays point to the need to allow adequate time  for tendering and implementation due to NHEPP energy shut-down schedules, logistical  challenges (i.e., mountainous location, regional transportation obstacles, and absence of air  transport), complexity of and difficulties in civil works, and limited local sources. Also, ADB should  ensure that in future BT and PMU fully understand its procurement processes from project  inception through training and explanation in the project administration memorandum of the  importance of timely and accurate procurement.",Project plans must have adequate time to deliver projects in complex circumstances while complying with ADB processes. 
"Following the lessons learned from the completed 220 kV GIS, the project applied a  different approach and arrangement as remedial action for civil works acceleration. Based on their  nature, the construction works were divided into five different lots to employ more local  subcontractors47 (against only one involved in the 220 kV GIS project) to enable them to have  access to larger man power and civil material resources, and to work simultaneously thus  reducing further delays and poor performance in the completion of civil works.",Dividing up civil works in lots and employing more local subcontractors improved quality and timeliness of civil works.
"As the newly built 500 kV GIS comprises advanced technology and is the first of this type  in Tajikistan, its proper and reliable O&M requires new skills. Therefore, further onsite training  and extension of the defect liability period from 18 months to 24 months are needed to ensure the  sustainability of the project's operational life. 45 Business enterprises and the population benefit from a stable electricity supply service and long-term cost reductions resulting from the economic distribution of electricity from NHEPP and the efficiencies gained from the enhanced  transmission. 46 Through NHEPP's new sustainable and reliable power generation the (i) the crucial role of frequency regulation in  Central Asia will be achieved again, and (ii) surplus energy to Uzbekistan (through the 500 kV Nurek–Regar–Guzar  transmission lines) will be supplied again after Tajikistan's power system reconnection to CAPS (expected in 2018). 47  Subcontractors were selected among the prequalified, locally available companies and approved by BT. The  prequalification was based on (i) contractor experience, (ii) references, (iii) staff capacity (workers and engineers),  and (iv) availability of machinery.",Appropriate training programs are required to support operation and maintenance of projects using new technology.
"Design and monitoring framework. The baselines and targets included in the project  DMF should have been based on reliable and easily accessible data. The DMF indicators should  have been carefully defined to better align with country's commitments and ADB results  framework while leveraging existing global monitoring tools and platforms such as the Sustainable  Development Goals. At the project level, for instance, traffic and fatalities are better measured by  “density targets” i.e., average daily vehicle-km or average crash rate per 100,000 vehicle-km of  travel.",Design and monitoring frameworks targets should be based on reliable and available data to measure project progress. 
"Capacity development. Most of the previous TA and projects in Tajikistan's road sector  had capacity development elements within their scope. This led to short and piecemeal inputs  over time, which made it difficult to sustain benefits at the institutional and sector levels. This was  compounded by the staff turnover in MOT management and the overall focus on civil works and  disbursements. Further emphasis is needed on capacity development to advance the road  sustainability agenda and deliver on the country's transport sector master plan (footnote 14).",Increased emphasis on capacity development is required to advance the road sustainability agenda in the transport sector
"Design and specification changes. During implementation, some designs and  specifications were revised to better adjust to site conditions and improve the quality of  construction material. Some of the engineering design standards (e.g., Asian Highway standards)  and the design-and-build approach used in the main civil works contract were new to the  executing agency, which led to some misunderstandings. This required resolution by  management staff from the contractor, PMWSC, and PIURR, which took a lot of time and delayed  the addressing of project requirements. If this approach is to be used, care is needed in project  and bidding document preparation so (i) the contractor can program its design and works in  accordance with its method statement, and (ii) the executing agency can ensure approval of the  engineering design in accordance with prevailing government procedures. Regarding (ii), a  clearer framework is needed to ensure that design or specification changes are reviewed by  relevant authorities and approved in a timely fashion. This will avoid causing contractual delays  while enhancing the transparency and robustness of audit processes.",Clear design and bidding document specifications are required for process transparency and to avoid contracting delays  
"Bills of quantities. In the main civil works contract, bills of quantities were sometimes  overly complex and time-consuming in measuring simple items of work. For instance, for simple  culverts, there could be 11 separate items requiring small measurements: excavation, gravel  bedding, lean mix concrete foundation, pipes, pipe joints, reinforcing in end walls, concrete volume in end walls, waterproofing, and backfilling. If the requirements were specified and  detailed on the drawings, a simple linear meter rate incorporating all those items would have been  included. Once the work had been inspected and found compliant, measurement would have  been simpler and more accurate. This approach would have simplified contract administration  without any negative impact on project cost and quality.",Clear contract terms and input requirements are needed to more quickly and accurately confirm completion of works. 
"Optimize project management. To strengthen project management, it is vital to (i) clearly  define the roles and responsibilities of members of the project leading group to intensify  interdepartmental cooperation; and (ii) make efforts to minimize replacement of staff to ensure  continuity in project management experience and smoother implementation.",Clearly define project lead roles and responsibilities and minimize staff turnover to strengthen project management.  
Establishing market links benefits the poor. Awareness about markets and access to  market information meant the farmers could make informed trading decisions. Additional benefit  was gained when individual farmers linked up with agro-enterprises through guaranteed buyback  schemes. Farmers could benefit from higher prices than those available in the open market and  now have a secured income source based on buyback contracts. Agro-enterprises benefited from  access to commodities that were of the required quality and strengthened their resource base.  The “enterprise + production base + farmer” model that was applied in this project was successful  and demonstrated that market links can be mutually beneficial.,Awareness campaigns about market links benefit the poor with higher prices and the buyers with security of supply. 
"Technical support and training are crucial elements. Access to technical training was  the most appreciated aspect of the project after access to loans. The training provided those who  took out loans with the skills, knowledge, and capacity to apply good agriculture practices and  use latest technologies such as water-efficient irrigation systems and integrated pest  management, all of which resulted in high-quality produce. Farmers were confident to manage  their production systems with the new skills they learned and could access the follow-up technical  support provided.",Technical training is needed to give borrowers skills in good agriculture practices to deliver high-quality produce.
"Access to rural finance is transformative. The project achieved its objective to increase  rural incomes through improved agriculture production by giving loans to poor rural households,  which allowed them to invest in perennial, annual, and livestock production. These loans were  suitable for poor rural farmers because they had lower interest rates and longer tenors than the  loans typically available at commercial banks. They were more in line with the return on  investments that can be achieved from agricultural production systems, and allowed the poor  households to repay them without undue stress. All households that took out loans used the funds  for the purpose intended and repaid the loans. Giving the poor access to finance can enable them  to seize opportunities to increase their incomes and improve their livelihoods.",Access to rural finance is needed to increase poor rural farmer incomes.
"Project preparation is important. A key element of the project's success was the  preparation of templates for the production base construction contract, the loan guarantee 16  ADB. 2Guidelines for the Evaluation of Public Sector Operations.

Although the process took time to prepare in the first year of implementation, once  completed, it was easy to implement and resulted in timely project completion.","Advance preparation of standard document templates is needed to ensure standardized, timely project implementation."
"Post-construction performance-based maintenance. The contractors' performance in  post-construction performance-based maintenance was poor due to the inadequate deployment  of equipment and labor, primarily due to the low rates quoted for post-construction maintenance  for these contracts. Due to their general construction orientation, the contractors did not carry  out post-construction maintenance adequately. In addition, PWD staff were unfamiliar with  supervising performance-based maintenance contracts. It was difficult to determine the  contractors' liability according to performance parameters for damage caused by heavy rains,  snow, or geological factors, which are highly prevalent in Uttarakhand. These lessons were  incorporated under subsequent tranches by strengthening the contractual provisions for  undertaking post-construction maintenance and conducting training and capacity-building  programs for the PWD staff and contractors.",Role of the post-construction phase critical to success. 
"Infrastructure management component. The project's infrastructure management  component delivered useful reports imparting an international outlook as to how the PWD  should be reorganized and perform its operations. However, the consultants' short 1-year  contract period resulted in inadequate interaction between the IMC and the PWD's senior  management and slowed the achievement of the milestones established under the project's  infrastructure management component. A longer contract period for consulting services and  more intensive inputs are required to sensitize the PWD's senior management and state  government and facilitate the design and implementation of an institutional development and  capacity- building program. Nonetheless, activities initiated during the services of IMC were   continued by the consultants engaged under subsequent tranches of the MFF.",Better alignment of the timing and terms of reference of the consultant with the project's capacity building objectives.
"Design and monitoring framework. Some of the expected performance targets and  indicators formulated in the DMF were aligned more with the overall investment program, and a  separate DMF for the project was not prepared. Apart from the DMF for the MFF, a DMF should  be prepared for each tranche under the MFF, which should be distinct, specific, and directly  attributable to the respective tranche so that its achievement against the project-specific  indicators and targets can be suitably evaluated.",MFF Project processing including DMF development  
"Ensure high due diligence of associated facilities. Due diligence of associated  facilities, funded by the private sector and other agencies, and identification of the likely risks and  their proper mitigation are critical to the success of the projects. Appropriate agreements on the  use of facilities, and the risk-sharing and guaranteed revenue mechanism with beneficiaries and  end-users must be ensured at the project appraisal stage and before the financing commitment.",Ensure high due diligence of associated facilities. 
"Ensure the implementation period is realistic. The project implementation plan should  be realistic.

(ii) Effective use of advance contracting and retroactive financing ensured efficient  project implementation and helped enable all project activities to be completed by  the original loan closing date. (iii) The main reason the contract price is lower than the engineering estimate is  inaccuracies in the engineering cost estimate. (iv) The initial imprest account ceiling was set at 10% of the approved loan amount;  this proved insufficient for a project that effectively used advance contracting and  retroactive financing, and was increased to 15% of the approved loan amount. (v) Public participation should have been strengthened by involving more local people  who lived in low density areas around the subproject sites, far from communities. (vi) The establishment of a good and workable grievance redress procedure is  important in resolving grievances. (vii) Dialogue and consultation with affected persons helps in resolving grievances.  (viii) Smooth LAR implementation benefits from careful preparation of resettlement plans during project preparation, including clear definition of land ownership,  strong coordination between project preparation consultants and executing and  implementing agencies, and understanding of resettlement plans by executing and  implementing agencies before ADB approval of the resettlement plans.","Project planning, management and due diligence.

They should be properly monitored and managed by keeping at a manageable number.",Covenants and conditions in the loan agreement and the project agreement. 
"Key lessons derived from the project design, implementation and completion: (i) Successful implementation of infrastructure project requires adequate social  preparation and continued engagement with the local communities. The project  was successful in engaging with local communities and address their immediate  needs with social infrastructure and support services. This helped gain their trust  and buy-in for the project. (ii) Since the MFF will be executed in 10 years, adequate institutional capacity within  the executing and implementing agencies is required. It was premature for a new  state with weak capacity. Other financing options would have been more  appropriate. (iii) Uttarakhand being a special category state, 90% of the central government  external debt fund is passed on to the project as a grant. However, the CERC Tariff  Regulation does not allow its return, interest, and depreciation in the revenue  calculation. While grant funding may benefit end-users due to a lower tariff, it may  not be an appropriate funding model for a revenue-earning agency like PTCUL. (iv) The project DMF had indicated a risk factor in achieving the project outcome  should the hydro projects not be completed on time. However, the risk mitigation  measures were not adequately planned. (v) Core functions of UED are administrative in nature; its priority and focus are mostly  on policy formulation and regulation of energy sector for the state. UED did not  have adequate project management and engineering staff. Hence, for UED, the  role as a project executing agency was conflicting and therefore, it was less  effective. The PMO also could not contribute effectively except as a role of the  secretariat. (vi) The second component of the project on institutional strengthening did not have a  need-based framework for capacity development in the project design stage. For  capacity development, the project could have benefitted from establishing cross- learning processes in project management, technical competency, and social  engineering among PTCUL, UJVNL and UED with other utilities. In the absence of  strong PMO and UED's ownership, the mid-term review of late 2012 also could not  help in developing such cross-learning framework.",Selection of financing modality and institutional capacity strengthening
"Lessons learned bear out the same lessons from earlier policy-based programs: (i) build  on ownership for reform; (ii) build on existing efforts; (iii) accommodate evolving policy dialogue; (iv) carefully time the intervention; (v) employ participation and build consensus; (vi) incorporate  the need for capacity and institutional development; (vii) keep the design simple and allow for  flexibility in the design; (viii) sequence reforms; and (ix) monitor progress (footnote 7). One further  lesson, given the experience of this program, is for ADB to stay fully engaged with the program  of reforms, whether or not program funds are scheduled to be disbursed in a particular year. All  future policy-based programs should be directed to consider these lessons in program design. In  retrospect, a stand-alone policy-based grant and loan would have been preferable to a  programmatic approach.",Scaling reforms through policy based lending

"Choice of project modality, scope, and implementation arrangements should be carefully  assessed and deliberately considered at project preparation. Project management faced  challenges beginning with initial implementation as the project comprised multiple  subcomponents scattered across many locations, resulting in a multilayered project  administrative structure. Combined with a requirement to conclude on-lending agreements  backed by stringent counter-guarantee arrangements across the PIAs and local governments, the  required coordination among relevant local government agencies was significant. It resulted in (i)  limited flexibility to respond to immediate implementation needs; and (ii) delays, which resulted in  advanced implementation of several subproject without the use of ADB loan financing. A flexible  approach that allowed individual subprojects to become effective when individual requirements  were met would have avoided this situation.",Complex projects should use appropriate flexible financing modalities to reduce implementation inefficiencies and delays.
"Urban development plans should be thoroughly reviewed and assessed to identify  potential risks at project preparation and thereby minimize subsequent changes in scope, and  attendant implementation delays. The district heating subproject faced a change in heat source  location, which affected both the original scope of works and implementation schedule.

Constraints in capacity requirements can also be addressed through a phased approach  in implementing the various components. There were many components being simultaneously  implemented. Better sequencing may have improved implementation by allowing the personnel  implementing and supervising the works to focus on fewer components.

"The results of the prefeasibility study should be subject to further examination in the  feasibility study in complex engineering project. As the preliminary study of the Interconnection  conducted by NPC suggested one particular option, NPC was reluctant to include a comparative  study to examine alternatives in the Consultant's TOR, and ADB accepted this position. As a  result, the Project experienced some delays and additional costs when the recommendation of  the POE on the configuration of the Interconnection (para. 28) was adopted. ADB and EAs  should be cautious not to limit technical alternatives to a minimum number, and to make TORs  flexible enough to allow consultants to propose other alternatives that should benefit the  projects, especially in complex engineering studies.",Complex studies require flexible consultant TORs
"No vehicle weigh bridges and environmental equipment were procured because LPCD  decided to procure the equipment with its own resources upon completion of the Liaoning  expressways network through LPCD's own resources. However, the expressway was opened in  October 2000 and the expressways network is expected to be completed in 2002, and so the  equipment should have been installed as early as possible. The design and distribution of such  facilities should be determined well in advance, preferably before project implementation, so  that procurement and installation could be completed before the expressways are fully  operational.","If preparedness is weak at the design stage, associated facilities for safety and maintenance were not completed when roads were open to public.

"The project schedule developed at appraisal required all project contracts to be awarded  either before or immediately after grant approval and did not provide for an interval between grant  approval and grant effectivity. This was unrealistic. Furthermore, even though a grant covenant  required that the contractor shall not be allowed access to any section of the line route until all  resettlement issues were resolved, the project schedule made no provision for their resolution. In  an EPC contract—in which the contractor is responsible for design—the design approval,  resolution of resettlement issues, and construction are sequential activities, and this should be  provided in the project schedule. Project schedules should also incorporate realistic timeframes  for processing of contracts, and ideally provide some accommodation for inevitable delays.",Sequencing of project works

"Procurement and low bid prices. This has been observed as a growing phenomenon  across many ADB projects, as well as those funded by other donors, in the PRC. This  phenomenon is a result of many issues, including overestimating during bid preparation, price  analysis during bid evaluation, and low capacity of the implementing agency in contract  management. Most specifically, the cost estimate in the procurement plan is based on a feasibility  study report in the PRC, and the risk premium is always high in feasibility study report estimates.  More advance preparation will improve the accuracy of the cost estimates. While a recent  procurement reform in ADB should help address this situation,30 certain additional measures  should be considered to avoid further negative impacts on loan utilization. Such measures could  be related to more accurate bid preparations, including detailed designs and cost estimates, and  price analysis during bid evaluation. ADB and the PMO should make significant efforts to  strengthen the capacity of the implementing agency on procurement matters. Improvements in  the existing PRC's tracking system for sanctioned local bidders would also be essential for  addressing the problem. 30 The latest Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers refer to cases of abnormally low bids, where after careful examination, the borrower is given the option to reject the bid or request that the amount of the performance security  be increased at the expense of the bidder.",Accuracy of cost estimates
"Project extensions related to land acquisition and resettlement. Local governments  in the PRC are increasingly adopting a more cautious approach towards solving land acquisition  and resettlement issues. This has often led to extensions requests by the borrower in order to  complete the implementation of the project. When considering such type of extension requests,  ADB should undertake an extensive due diligence to assess whether the completion of the project  is achievable within the proposed extended timeline. This due diligence should not be just  undertaken by the project implementation consultants but also by an external specialist contracted  for this specific task.",Project implementation extension due to land acquisition
"Overall, the project was less than successful. 23  The project was implemented with  substantial delays and major changes in the financing plan, within project cost but with 69.3% of  ADB loan proceeds canceled. It was completed with a delay of over 4 years and required the  use of additional government resources. The total project cost was reduced because ADB and  the government did not extend the loan. The government has continuous ownership and  leadership of the Treasury's modernization, but has reduced its commitment to the PFM reform  timeline.",Government ownership in PFM reform
"PMO and executing agency staff need to improve their understanding of the agreed  timing, ADB's procurement guidelines, and government laws and regulations on procurement to  minimize any conflict between ADB guidelines and government requirements before starting  procurement. This includes involving the executing agency's bidding committee members early  in the project to avoid any possible conflict during procurement.",Early involvement of bidding committee members early
"One of the more significant issues was managing borrower expectations, particularly (i)  the time needed to complete the procurement process under ADB guidelines and (ii) the  expected versus the actual bid prices. Both issues caused distress between the donor and the  executing agency—expectations of the time needed to complete a transaction are often  unrealistic and bid prices are higher than expected—especially when the executing agency has  limited exposure to ADB procedures and to the prices of the goods and services proposed  under the project.",Unrealistic bid prices
"Land pooling proved to be a highly effective process for urban development. Financing an  untested and innovative approach clearly resulted in transformational impacts regarding how  urban areas are developed in the country. The key delay at start-up was corrected by starting  work in a subset of one local area where 100% agreement had already been achieved (para. 25).  Another lesson learned in land pooling is that proper sequencing of works can lead to better  outcomes. Initially, roads were finished in the areas under land pooling prior to private building  construction, which led to extensive road damage from movement of heavy vehicles (para. 17).", Transformations in urban area development

"In comparison with previous urban loans, the project increased coverage to more cities.  The uneven capacities in three areas were reflected through the funds allocated to the areas and  the capacity building program designed under the project. Dagana was an area that ADB had not  previously supported and it is also where there were some quality issues in the infrastructure built.  Capacity could not be built as envisioned because of changes in government policy related to the  funding of training. This could have been better bridged by increased consulting services;  however, toward the end of the project, there was also increased focus on optimizing consulting  services in donor-funded projects, which made it difficult to increase allocations to Dagana.

"all consultants were recruited following the adb guidelines on the use of consultants (2006 as amended from time to time) and the projects’ procurement plans. consulting firms were selected and engaged using adb’s quality and cost-based selection method. all works and goods were procured in accordance with adb procurement guidelines (2006 as amended from time to time). project 1 planned six consultancy packages (appendix 6, table a6.1); one each for (i) design and construction supervision for infrastructure rehabilitation and upgrade, (ii) project preparation facility, (iii) pmu support, (iv) groundwater management, (v) on-farm water management and agriculture, and (vi) institutional strengthening and operation modernization. the consultant’s recruitment was slow and took about two years to contract award. during implementation, the services under the six packages were reduced, rationalized, or extended under agreement between adb and pid. works were divided into multiple packages: (i) two pilot packages; (ii) one package for balloki barrage; (iii) three packages for lbdc canal; (iv) two packages for the distribution system, one each for okara and sahiwal divisions; and (v) two for the khanewal division distribution system (appendix 6. table a6.2). adb pre-qualification process was used for packages (i) to (iv), and post qualification for package (v). except for package (i), all packages were procured through international competitive bidding (icb). construction and contract management by contracting parties were weak, which led to slow progress. ​",capacity assessment of the construction industry needs to be completed before rolling out contract packages.
"the design required long-term investments with sector reforms and continued government engagement to achieve a transformation in water service delivery, including infrastructure rehabilitation; surface, groundwater and on-farm management; and changing irrigation institutional architecture in project areas. the mff modality was an appropriate financing instrument, offering an opportunity for long-term engagement, but poor project readiness, short project duration and high reforms targets made the design complex and ambitious. during implementation, changes in the approach to institutional strengthening improved project design relevance and ensured harmony with other devolved systems in canal command areas. engineering design changes enhanced flood resilience and irrigation conveyance efficiencies. the piappf’s scope increased, with $1.7 billion worth of projects prepared. adb’s contribution was complemented by support from the world bank and the japan international cooperation agency for on-farm agricultural enhancement, infrastructure upgrade and institutional reforms. as a result, the project remained relevant until its completion.",aligning institutional and operational changes with the overall reform environment enhances the success potential of irrigation modernization schemes.
"this component proved to be more challenging at implementation stage and several design issues were addressed. the government of punjab created a working group in 2008 to streamline institutional reforms and address the challenges. the project established (i) an area water board at the main lbdc level, (ii) 53 farmer organizations at the distributary level, and (iii) 3,779 khal panchayat at the water course level. with the punjab irrigation and drainage authority (pida) at the provincial level, this completed the four-tier irrigation institution structure in the project command area. 14 the number of farmer organizations was decreased from about 70 at appraisal to 53 based on reassessment of hydrologic boundaries and the size of distributary canals. operationalization of 53 farmer organizations was completed in 2012, followed by the signing of irrigation management transfer agreements during 2012–2015. this was a result of an extensive social mobilization program, including awareness campaigns and elections. more than 16,000 familiarizations, rapport building activities, and consultations were conducted. ​",aligning institutional and operational changes with the overall reform environment enhances the success potential of irrigation modernization schemes.

"works were divided into 10 packages: two pilot packages, two balloki barrage packages, three lbdc packages, and three distribution system packages—one in each of okara, sahiwal, and khanewal. later, the two balloki barrage packages were merged in one package and the khanewal distribution system was split into two packages. the average award time taken for civil works was about 21 months (appendix 8, table a8.5). the performance of contractors, and design and construction supervision consultants remained generally weak in construction management and contract administration. all the contracts, except for two, exceeded their contract period. component 3 consultants mostly completed their assignments at the scheduled time. the pmu support consultants provided much-needed support during the last 3 years of the project when the pmu could not refill vacant positions and remained preoccupied with preparing new subprojects during the transition to the pmo canals.",early involvement of the relevant executing agency (ea) units in project implementation increases ownership and facilitates smooth takeover of the operational phase.
"the design was overambitious given the fragile and recently post-conflict environment in timor-leste when the project was prepared, the institutional capacity of the key agencies, dnsa and directorate of the ministry of public works (mpw), the behavioral change required of consumers, and the timelines required for procurement and implementation.6 dnsa’s institutional capacity was assessed during project preparation, with measures identified to improve planning, monitoring, operating systems, and service delivery. the support to be provided during the technical assistance for the dili water supply performance improvement aimed to enhance dnsa’s capacity.",a thorough assessment of the enabling environment and government capacities must be undertaken before embarking on development projects in fragile and post-conflict countries
"the overall project is rated less than successful. while the project sector loan modality was appropriate and responsive, the project design did not reflect the institutional capacity and operating environment and was overoptimistic in what could be achieved in outputs, outcomes, and impact with a pilot project. the government’s commitment to institutional reform and provision of further investment for the water supply system, and for the operating costs of the system did not eventuate, as indicated by the non-compliance with covenants. the performance of the borrower, as well as the executing agency are rated less than satisfactory, while adb’s performance in project implementation and administration is rated satisfactory.",a thorough assessment of the enabling environment and government capacities must be undertaken before embarking on development projects in fragile and post-conflict countries
"while the project design was relevant in focusing on the key underlying causes of the poor water supply in dili, it was overambitious in terms of the required scope and necessary integration of activities, and timelines to achieve the planned outputs and outcomes in a fragile and recently conflict-affected country (paras. 7, 8, and 9). for this reason, the project is rated less than relevant. given the state of the water system prior to the project, the limited capacity of the relevant institutions, and consumers who treated water as a free commodity, the project had to address core institutional capacity, community awareness, and behavioral change, combined with infrastructure investment and development of sustainable systems. as such, the range of interventions in the design should have been more focused and integrated, with a more limited scope (in terms of coverage given the level of funds). investment at a zonal level rather than at the sub-zone level, and a stronger emphasis on the supporting utility capacity and institutional reform, and the streamlining of payment and collection systems would have had a greater potential as a pilot project to demonstrate best practice that could have been replicated subject to additional funding.","a flexible approach to financing operating costs, operation and maintenance (o&m) contracts, and the provision of the required national expertise may need to be incorporated in post-conflict water supply improvement projects."
"these six covenants were realistic in terms of the requirements to develop a sustainable institution that provides reliable services. the timeline required for some actions could have been extended to strengthen ownership and effectiveness. while the non-compliance was raised with the government and noted in review mission reports, limited remedial action was taken by the government to rectify the shortfall.",a well-defined partnership agreement with the timor-leste government is necessary to achieve water sector policy reforms and build adequate national capacity for developing sustainable safe water supply systems.
"the project faced significant implementation delays with six extensions of the closing date. the phasing of the key consulting contracts and civil works contracts was poor due to procurement, recruitment delays, and mobilization issues, which resulted in training being provided before it could be used, and loss of trained individuals prior to the project activity being implemented. the small size of the pmu and the non-implementation of the performance.","a series of short extensions, which can create unnecessary administrative burdens, must be avoided."
"similarly, the restructuring of the dnsa into an independent financial entity did not occur. the demand management task force, leak detection and caretakers were not in place, so the ta was unable to provide the planned training. the pic provided the training later during the project. the ta design was based on three key conditions that did not occur: (i) the mpw would allocate sufficient resources to the dnsa, (ii) the dnsa would be restructured to become a commercially focused water business, and (iii) the ta and the project would be implemented concurrently. these shortfalls reduced the ta output achievements and expected outcomes.","a series of short extensions, which can create unnecessary administrative burdens, must be avoided."

"the sector project modality was the appropriate approach for timor-leste, given the government’s institutional, policy, and investment framework. it provided the opportunity to prioritize the investments using sub-zone (project) selection criteria based on technical, financial, and social criteria. the project design addressed key causes of poor and inadequate water supply and service provision, and the project’s design monitoring framework (dmf) included relevant target indicators. the project outcome and output targets and achievements, as detailed in the project’s report and recommendation of the president, are provided in the dmf in appendix 1.5 the project preparation and fact-finding involved stakeholder participation and consultation. the dmf included one gender-based impact indicator on benefits to women. given it was an urban water supply project that would have a significant impact on women, additional indicators should have been considered covering women as customers and as participants in project activities.",benefits for women should be distinctively planned and pursued in all water supply projects.
"the customer satisfaction, as measured by the number of complaints per thousand customers, improved during the project implementation. however, the number of complaints may not be an accurate measure of performance, as it is a manual system that involves a very lengthy response time, and customers are aware they are unlikely to get a reply and action to a malfunctioning water problem and on this basis take no action. no data or survey collection was undertaken on the benefit to women from the improved water supply services, so this impact indicator could not be measured. ​",benefits for women should be distinctively planned and pursued in all water supply projects.
"at appraisal, the envisaged project would be implemented over 5 years, with a 31 december 2014 completion date. advance contracting enabled dor to recruit the detailed design consultant to start in late 2009; the contract agreement was executed on 24 february 2010. the detailed design consultant completed the design work on schedule in september 2010. the construction supervision consultant—selected in may 2011, with contract signing on 20 may 2011—mobilized immediately and completed the work in june 2015.","contract and project durations and cost estimates for road projects in bhutan should consider the steepness of terrain, whether the civil works are greenfield or brownfield, and impacts of the monsoon season."
"the civil works for the project included seven contract packages: five for national highways and two for feeder roads. the procurement of civil works contracts began in october 2010 as planned. the procurement process took longer than the dor anticipated, requiring ministerial level sign-off and formation of a ministerial tender committee with five to six members, including the secretary. the contracts for all seven packages were signed between july and november 2011; contracts for three packages started in october and november 2011, and the remaining four started in early 2012. the civil works started almost 1 year later than planned, which further delayed the progress of civil works during implementation. all contracts required the works to be completed within 32 months, regardless of contract value, location, and geotechnical and topographical conditions. this time schedule was not achievable.","contract and project durations and cost estimates for road projects in bhutan should consider the steepness of terrain, whether the civil works are greenfield or brownfield, and impacts of the monsoon season."
"contract periods for all civil works were extended by 92–410 days, largely because of physical hindrances, primarily heavy rainfall during monsoon seasons, which ceased all activities on the project for 3–4 months. there were also delays in obtaining permits for machinery import. because of the extent of the delays, the civil works packages could not be completed by the original grant closing date. adb approved extending the grant closing date by 1 year. the extension enabled the dor to fully complete the works and achieve the intended project objectives. the civil works for two of the seven contracts were completed in may and october 2014, while the remainder were completed in may, july, august, and october 2015. all civil works contracts were completed by the extended grant closing date of 30 june 2016. the actual implementation schedule compared to the original at appraisal is in appendix 5 and a chronology of major events is in appendix 6","contract and project durations and cost estimates for road projects in bhutan should consider the steepness of terrain, whether the civil works are greenfield or brownfield, and impacts of the monsoon season."

"adb’s project completion mission observed routine maintenance in place but also locations with substantial potholes, damaged drainage structures, and areas of pavement failure. the roads were damaged by landslides and/or heavy trucks. portions of the manitar–raidak road had severe damage due to landslides, which render the road impassable during monsoon season. in a dor investigation in 2017, engineers visited the panbang–nganglam road and checked the road design, construction quality, and geotechnical conditions of the project road. the investigating team concluded that: (i) the road damage was mainly caused by overloaded trucks carrying cement from nganglam to hydropower project sites; (ii) the detailed design did not consider such heavily loaded vehicles transporting cement; (iii) geological conditions cause the pavement to remain wet all year round; and (iv) no construction defects were detected. the hydropower project has now concluded and the dor regional office plans to strengthen and rehabilitate the pavement. a new design has been prepared and the project is planned for implementation next year, subject to budget approvals.",road maintenance should be incorporated in future road projects financed by the asian development bank (adb) in bhutan.

"though some periodic maintenance was delayed because of budget limitations, the government is committed to allocating the necessary budget to the extent possible to avoid faster deterioration of the roads. road maintenance is currently completed manually, which can be a challenge because of a labor shortage. the dor is gradually moving towards mechanizing road maintenance: it plans to purchase road profile measuring equipment and is also considering centralizing labor and equipment in road maintenance centers. they are currently at the concept stage, and dor plans to pilot two such centers. the ta established a road asset management system, and the dor further expanded this system after project completion (appendix 8). the dor intends to use the road asset management system to analyze budgets and allocate resources for road maintenance.",road maintenance should be incorporated in future road projects financed by the asian development bank (adb) in bhutan.

"the project is rated relevant at appraisal and completion. the project’s formulation was aligned with the governments’ development objectives, adb’s development strategy for regional cooperation in general, and the ict subsector in particular, both at appraisal (para. 4) and completion (para. 6). while the project’s design was relevant at appraisal, the very rapid changes in the ict sector globally and in sasec countries during implementation was beyond the control of the project. the number of fixed broadband subscriptions increased five times and mobile cellular subscriptions three times in south asia from 2007 to 2012. 42 during that period, bangladesh and bhutan both recorded an annual growth rate of 69% in broadband subscriptions, and in nepal it was 84%. the annual growth rate in mobile subscriptions was 23% in bangladesh, 30% in bhutan, and 38% in india. the project was not designed to fully adapt to these rapid advances, as exemplified by the implementation arrangements (paras. 8, 9 and 35) and the flaws in the dmf (para. 9 and appendix 1), and this was compounded by the significant delay in implementation. moreover, the project design was not guided by detailed demand analyses and instead assumed that all the internet data traffic that was exchanged through very small aperture terminals (vsat) at the time would switch entirely to the regional network. further, for the rtn, the needs of the potential users were not adequately reflected in the design of the courses (para. 58).43 this could be attributed to the project’s modality whereby the rtn component was scoped out of the rest of the project in the form of a ta project, limiting coordination with the village network. nonetheless, the innovative and pioneering nature of the project, which aimed at facilitating the integration of information, knowledge, and ideas across sasec, should be highly commended. the objectives of the project remain relevant since the provision of stable, affordable and inclusive internet connection, especially in the most remote and rural areas has not been achieved fully in the sasec countries and remains a key for inclusive development. the innovative and transformative nature of the project is highly aligned with adb’s strategy 2030, which emphasizes promoting innovative technologies and integrated solutions for building the potential for adb’s value addition",project design should consider all the factors that can affect implementation.
"other issues with the project’s design include inadequate consideration of the time required to conclude a series of agreements essential for implementation (paras. 33, 58 and 60), the lack of project management and a mechanism for regional coordination (para. 59), and a disconnection between project outputs and outcomes and their performance indicators and targets",creation of a flexible but hands-on regional mechanism to coordinate and perform monitoring and oversight functions will benefit the implementation of regional projects.

"the program’s complex design, including seven sub-outputs, required managing many actors across multiple sectors.22 subsequent adb missions noted that the program’s implementation arrangements required strengthening to ensure synergies between outputs and the cumulative benefits of the investment. at the midterm review (mtr), the moh and adb conducted a review of pmu capacity and prepared actions to strengthen stakeholder coordination, project management, procurement, provincial supervision, and financial management. effective execution of these actions contributed, in part, to the improvement in project performance in project year-4 onwards.",reforms in hospital financing mechanisms require the engagement of agencies beyond the individual hospitals.
"the program design was modified at implementation. at inception, the executing agency assessed several indicators in the dmf as overly ambitious or requiring further definition to enable objective measurement. the indicators were subsequently revised (appendix 1). 9 during implementation, activities under output 3 were reoriented to focus on case-based payments using diagnosis-related groups (drgs) in response to external shifts in the moh’s policy direction on health financing reform.10",greater consideration should be given to ensuring the availability of data sources when preparing indicators.

"the project selected the private vocational colleges under loan b using the same criteria as the public vocational colleges, and the additional criteria of financial capacity and willingness to borrow. initially, the project identified five private vocational colleges, but in the end only three participated, including two that were not in the original list of five. this was because the project design could not address unforeseen changes in the lending environment, which led to four of the original five private vocational colleges failing a re-assessment of financial capacity to pay. 7",early assessment of the willingness of target borrowers and early decision on who bears the exchange rate and credit risks should be made in asian development bank- (adb) financed onlending schemes.
"the project remained relevant at completion, given its continued alignment with government policy and adb priorities. it is consistent with the government’s announcement in 2017 that all public technical and vocational education and training (tvet) institutions should become autonomous.27 the project enabled the public vocational colleges to attract private enterprises, increase enrolments, raise tuition, and generate revenues by upgrading their training equipment and upskilling their managers and teachers. it also remained consistent with adb’s country partnership strategy for viet nam, 2016–2020,28 which aims to support formal technical and vocational education that is linked with labor market demands. the project is also aligned with strategy 202029 under which adb will increasingly direct its attention to raising the quality of tvet. however, for loan b, the demand from the private colleges was minimal given the initially high interest rates. this also caused a delay in project implementation. although the higher interest rates—resulting from the global financial crisis in 2009—were not anticipated at the time of project design, with consultations and earlier involvement of the vdb, the credit and exchange risk could have been eliminated. the modality of project lending for loan a was still appropriate at completion. for loan b, direct lending to the private vocational colleges could have been a possibility, which would have avoided some of the problems encountered by the project. however, in that case, the colleges would have had to absorb all the credit and exchange rate risks and it is unclear how much demand there would have been for the loan. the project’s dmf was for the most part appropriate while some performance targets, such as on gender, were unrealistic.",early assessment of the willingness of target borrowers and early decision on who bears the exchange rate and credit risks should be made in asian development bank- (adb) financed onlending schemes.

"the project has contributed to substantial improvements in the national and provincial s&r systems. as a result, nearly 100% of all disease outbreaks were reported to the respective moh and the rcu within 24 hours, and investigated and responded to within 48 hours (i.e., cambodia and viet nam achieved this in 100% of cases, while the lao pdr did so in 84% of cases). the efficiency and reliability of the outbreak reporting system is a critical cornerstone of effective cdc. it relies on the technical judgment of frontline health workers to identify potentially important outbreaks, and to follow a standardized protocol to report and respond. technical training for cdc staff; investment in capacity development, including formulation of guidelines, standards, and protocols; and the provision of necessary tools such as internet and phone call credits enabled this achievement. the project further mobilized support and institutionalized regional cooperation mechanisms for cdc such that various forms of cross-border activities were regularly planned and organized. the clv countries shared the responsibility of organizing crossborder information exchange and other joint activities, and actively participated in such activities regularly. the frontline defense against communicable diseases was strengthened through improved hygiene and better prevention in the villages, as demonstrated in the mhvs. lastly, the malaria incidence in all targeted provinces declined dramatically as a result of delivering targeted interventions supported by the additional financing and other development partners.",effective communicable disease control starts in the communities.
"regional cooperation can be further enriched and deepened. the clv countries have taken ownership of the regional cooperation platform and noted the value of the rcu in planning regional events. in addition to information sharing and knowledge exchange, regional cooperation could be further enhanced through a formal agreement on joint simulation exercises; harmonized treatment protocols (e.g., for malaria, tuberculosis, and hiv/aids); and collaboration on tracking the mobile population, particularly those at high risk of communicable diseases. eventually, members of the gms or the association of southeast asian nations may aspire to a regional s&r system similar to the european cdc. adb facilitated the adoption of the gms health cooperation strategy in 2019. as a next project, adb has been requested to support migrant health in gms countries.",effective communicable disease control starts in the communities.

"the project generated about 3.25 million person-days of employment, each day worth about $3 under the ffw and cfw programs. the improvements in the stock of physical infrastructure from the cfw and civil works activities continue to reduce transport costs and travel time, save domestic water costs, and provide better access to social facilities and more reliable irrigation water across almost half of cambodia’s provinces. nearly 120,000 households received improved agriculture inputs, leading to significant—if variable—increases in rice productivity in a very short time.",innovations to enhance project outcomes are important.
"the government, executing agency, and implementing agencies exhibited a high level of ownership of the project from design through all stages of implementation. the government and executing agency proposed and initiated changes to the project scope, as needed, to address changing conditions. there were no implementation delays or major problems with procurement or disbursements, despite the large number of line ministries and other public agencies involved, the participation of a diverse range of local and international ngos, farmers’ associations, shgs, private sector entities, and united nations institutions, and the broad physical coverage of the project. 37 all covenants were complied with, and the extensions needed to complete project programs were mainly made to accommodate the new activities introduced. the short period for implementation of the additional financing—2.75 years—was compromised by delays due to the conduct of national elections and severe flooding.",participation fosters community ownership and sustainability of project benefits.
"mef executed the project and established a cpmu led by a project director, with overall guidance provided by the national food security task force. mef also established provincial project management units (ppmus) in all 7 provinces targeted by the project and in 10 provinces covered by the additional financing. technical support units were established within the implementing ministries and institutions (i.e., ministry of rural development, ministry of water resources and meteorology, maff, ministry of education, youth and sport, ministry of women’s affairs, ministry of commerce; the ncdm; and card). 28 provincial technical support units of the corresponding ministries were likewise established in target provinces. the project engaged wfp to implement the ffw scheme and school feeding program, and employed two ngos—cambodian center for study and development in agriculture (cedac), and buddhism for development—to monitor the distribution of free rice. under the additional financing, plan international provided services for the implementation of nutrition, health, sanitation, and diversified livelihoods training activities.",deep commitment from the project director is critical to project success.
"while the lead time needed for the agriculture quality improvement program to supply sufficient rice seed on time might have been foreseen during design, this must be seen in the context of the very short processing timeframe in mid-2008 and the wider appropriateness of the resulting major change of scope. adb’s dialogue with the gafsp was constructive in the design and formulation of the additional financing, and in accessing substantial finance with which to build upon the objectives and achievements of the original project. adb supervision missions for the project and additional financing were timely and frequent, and there was a high level of staffing continuity throughout the 8-year implementation period. delegation of project administration to the cambodia resident mission helped to build and maintain relationships with the government and other agency staff. adb’s performance is rated highly satisfactory.",deep commitment from the project director is critical to project success.
"based on the ratings for relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and likely sustainability, the project is rated successful. 38",deep commitment from the project director is critical to project success.
"the project experienced a cost overrun during implementation resulting from improved engineering design and price escalation. consequently, the government requested additional financing to achieve the project’s intended outputs while improving technical quality. additional engineering measures were by their nature an integral part of ongoing civil works, and additional financing was deemed the most suitable approach (other options were restructuring, scaling down, or canceling the project). the development objectives of the project remained unchanged with the additional financing, and the project was expected to remain technically, economically, and financially viable despite the cost overrun. the project is in line with adb’s strategy 2020 and aligns with the national strategy of sustainable development of the kyrgyz republic for 2013– 2017 (nssd); 6 and the country partnership strategy (cps), 2013–2017, for the kyrgyz republic, 7 which highlights regional cooperation, and includes improved road connectivity as a strategic priority. the additional financing met the eligibility criteria in adb’s additional financing policy. 8 adb approved an additional financing on 2 december 2014, including a loan of sdr7.258 million ($10.8 million equivalent) and a grant of $4.3 million both from adb’s special fund resources.","adequate technical, geological, and climate studies need to inform road engineering designs and project cost estimates."
"road improvement component. at appraisal, the project’s primary output was 60 km of the bishkek–torugart road rehabilitated with special structures to protect the environment, preserve the road structure, and reduce vehicle crashes. at completion, 60.033 km of the road section (km 478.580–538.613) was upgraded. the improvement included subgrade enforcement; surface repaving; construction of bridges, culverts and a drainage system; and installation of road safety facilities (traffic signs and road markings). the road section was designed to meet national category iii road standards with two lanes (carriage width of 7 meters) and a shoulder (2 meters width on each side). the design speed is 90 km per hour. to prevent cracking caused by a freeze– thaw cycle, an improved engineering design was incorporated during implementation with an additional 30 centimeter sub-grade layer and deeper side drainage, with additional costs covered by the additional financing. the protection measures for the chatyr-kul lake wetlands included an integrated system of drainage ditches and spill retention ponds, as well as provision of required environmental monitoring equipment. during construction, the supervision consultant inspected and assessed the works to make sure that the specifications were met. the adb missions observed that the rehabilitated road was of good quality, with an international roughness index (iri) below 3 by 2017 (as indicated by the additional financing revised dmf), with appropriate safety and environmental protection facilities provided.","adequate technical, geological, and climate studies need to inform road engineering designs and project cost estimates."
"at appraisal, the project cost was estimated at $70.0 million equivalent, including the base cost, contingency, and loan financial charges. the project experienced a cost overrun during implementation, mainly as a result of the improved engineering design and increases in the cost of resource inputs. 9 with the additional financing, the estimated total project cost increased to $88.0 million; the actual cost at completion was $82.15 million, or about 6.6% less the estimated cost at additional financing, but 17.4% more than that at original loan appraisal. the cost at completion was below that estimated at additional financing because of savings in (i) the cost of the supervision consultant ($3.43 million), (ii) project management costs ($0.65 million), (iii) capacity development costs ($0.69 million), and (iv) the financial charges ($1.03 million). in contrast, the civil works cost increased to $76.35 million, which was about 10.7% higher than estimated at additional financing, and 38.8% higher than estimated at appraisal. a comparison of project costs at appraisal, additional financing, and project completion is in appendix 2.","adequate technical, geological, and climate studies need to inform road engineering designs and project cost estimates."
"civil works contract. as planned at appraisal, motr procured a civil works contract for the road improvement component in accordance with adb’s procurement guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) using the international competitive bidding (icb) method. under the advanced contracting, the procurement for the civil works contract began with an invitation for prequalification in may 2011, four bidders were prequalified, and an invitation for bids was issued in may 2012 using a single-stage one-envelope procedure. the bid opening was held in june 2012, and the contract was awarded in august 2012. revisions in the engineering design and additional financing resulted in two contract variations being made to the civil works contract. 13","adequate technical, geological, and climate studies need to inform road engineering designs and project cost estimates."
"consultant for construction supervision. the overall performance of the supervision consultant, tera international group, inc., was satisfactory. it was planned that the supervision consultant would have a dual focus, on supervision of works and environmental management. the consultant provided efficient supervision and coordination between the contractor and ipig and ensured the quality of works in accordance with the contract specifications, despite the challenges of working at high altitude. during implementation, the team leader and some team members were replaced because of resignations related to altitude sickness. there were some project implementation delays, but in general the consultant provided its inputs on time. the consultant completed all tasks specified in the tor, including engineering reviews, construction supervision, environment monitoring, project survey and evaluation, progress report preparation, and provision of training. upon completion, the consultant provided 327.8 person-months of supervision consulting services, including 84.7 person-months of international and 243.1 personmonths of national expert services.",consulting packages should provide adequate hardship compensation and incentives.
"ucsa completed the project within the original loan closing date of 31 december 2016. the team achieved this despite some delays associated with the lengthy government feasibility approval process, recruitment of detailed design and project management consultants, and long drawn-out procurement of civil works contracts. the originally envisaged physical outputs were fully achieved. the project’s nonphysical outputs were only partially achieved as summarized in paras. 14−16.","streamlining government approval, consultant recruitment, and procurement review procedures will minimize implementation delays in asian development bank- (adb) assisted projects in uzbekistan."
"detailed design consultants. the original procurement plan included two detailed design consulting packages but the ppmu requested adb to split the packages between djizzak and karakalpakstan and khorezm from one into two packages.24 the other package was for the detailed design of andijan city sewerage network. adb reflected the revisions in the revised procurement plan. the delays in the pmcs recruitment; the limited capacity of the ppmu staff in preparation of consultant recruitment documents; some issues with the capacity of the design institute; and more time required by local agencies for data collection on sites, connections, and topography constrained the completion of the detailed design works.","streamlining government approval, consultant recruitment, and procurement review procedures will minimize implementation delays in asian development bank- (adb) assisted projects in uzbekistan."
"civil works. during the early stage of project implementation, ucsa concluded that three civil works packages as originally designed were unwieldy and hence, ucsa suggested increasing the number of packages from three to six. adb agreed to the revised civil works packages, including (i) rehabilitation and construction of sewerage networks in andijan city, approved in december 2013; (ii) rehabilitation of wss of djizzak subprojects, approved in february 2014; (iii) rehabilitation of wss of karakalpakstan subprojects, approved in january 2015; and (iii) rehabilitation of wss of khorezm subprojects, approved in august 2015. the repackaging of civil works contracts proved to be effective and efficient.25 ​ civil works, goods, and related services were procured in accordance with adb’s procurement guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). the ppmu awarded 19 contracts, including (i) four rehabilitation and construction of wss facilities through international competitive bidding; (ii) four supplies of special equipment through national competitive bidding; (iii) six small value contracts26 through shopping; and (iv) one pmc, three detailed designs, and one audit through quality- and cost-based selection and least-cost selection (appendix 8).",project implementing agencies (ias) should be staffed with qualified specialists with ownership and commitment.
